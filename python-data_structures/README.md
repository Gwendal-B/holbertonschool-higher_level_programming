# Holberton School Higher Level Programming - Python Data Structures

## Description
This project focuses on the implementation and understanding of various data structures in Python. It aims to provide a solid foundation in data structures, which are essential for efficient programming and algorithm development.

## Objectives
- Understand the fundamental data structures in Python.
- Implement data structures such as lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- Analyze the performance of different data structures and their operations.

## Data Structures Covered
- **Lists**: Understanding dynamic arrays and linked lists.
- **Stacks**: Implementing stack operations and applications.
- **Queues**: Implementing queue operations and their use cases.
- **Trees**: Exploring binary trees, binary search trees, and tree traversal methods.
- **Graphs**: Understanding graph representations and traversal algorithms.

## Installation
