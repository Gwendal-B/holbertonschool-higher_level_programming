# Python Inheritance

This directory contains projects and exercises focused on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Python, specifically inheritance.

## Topics Covered

- **Class Definition**: Creating and defining classes
- **Inheritance**: Single and multiple inheritance
- **Method Overriding**: Overriding parent class methods
- **Super()**: Using the super() function to call parent methods
- **Properties**: Using @property decorators
- **Abstract Classes**: Working with abstract base classes (ABC)

## Projects

Each subdirectory or file demonstrates different inheritance concepts through practical examples and exercises.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Basic understanding of OOP concepts

## Usage

Run Python files directly:
```bash
python3 filename.py
```

## Learning Objectives

- Understand parent/child class relationships
- Master method resolution order (MRO)
- Implement polymorphism
- Create reusable code through inheritance
